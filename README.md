Overview:
Machine Learning project to classify PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) using clinical, lifestyle, and hormonal data.

Dataset:
Records: 541
Features: 43 (Age, BMI, Cycle, Hormones, Follicle count, Lifestyle indicators, etc.)
Target: PCOS (Yes/No)

Methods:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (missing values, outliers, encoding).
Exploratory Data Analysis (age distribution, cycle irregularity, symptoms).
Models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Bagging, Boosting, XGBoost, Neural Network.

Results:
Key Risk Factors: High BMI, irregular cycles, fast food intake, less exercise, and hormonal imbalances.
Best Model: Neural Network (Accuracy: 92%, 80:20 split).
