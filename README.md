PCOS Analysis – Machine Learning Project
Overview :

This project analyzes Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using women’s clinical, lifestyle, and hormonal data. The dataset consists of 541 patient records with 43 attributes, labeled to indicate PCOS diagnosis (Yes/No).
Our goal is to build a predictive system for early detection of PCOS using machine learning.

Objectives :

Clean and preprocess the dataset.

Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to identify trends and correlations.

Apply machine learning classification models.

Identify the most accurate model for prediction.

 Dataset Information :

Instances: 541

Features: 43 (clinical, lifestyle, and hormonal)

Target Attribute: PCOS (1 = PCOS, 0 = Non-PCOS)
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

PCOS is more common in women under 30 years.

Irregular cycles strongly correlate with PCOS.

Patients with PCOS are less likely to be pregnant.

Common symptoms: pimples, skin darkening, excess hair growth, weight gain.

High follicle count and changes in endometrium thickness are strong diagnostic indicators.

Model Performance :

Among the applied machine learning algorithms, the Neural Network (ANN) achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 92% (80:20 split), outperforming all other models.
